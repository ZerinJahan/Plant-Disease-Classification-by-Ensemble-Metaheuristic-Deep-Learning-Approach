# Plant-Disease-Classification-by-Ensemble-Metaheuristic-Deep-Learning-Approach
The project titled "Plant Disease Classification by Ensemble Metaheuristic-Deep Learning Approach" focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and metaheuristic algorithms to accurately identify plant diseases from leaf images. Utilizing computer vision and image processing, the system is designed to classify 20 different plant disease classes. Key components of the project include feature extraction, deep learning model implementation (such as EfficientNet, RegNet, and MaxViT), and the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms like LOA, OOA, NTSO, and PMOA for enhancing model performance. The project compares the classification accuracy with and without the use of these metaheuristic algorithms to evaluate their impact on model optimization. The system is developed using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab, and leverages libraries and tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for model building, data preprocessing, training, and result visualization.
